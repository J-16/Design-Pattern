Design Principle:

  -> Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

  -> Program to an interface and no to an implementation.

  -> Favour Composition over Inheritance.

The Strategy Pattern
  Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
